This repository contains a COBOL program with a bug related to data truncation in a customer name field.  The program fails to handle cases where customer names exceed the allocated storage, potentially leading to data corruption or program termination.  The solution demonstrates how to handle oversized inputs through improved data validation and dynamic memory allocation (where applicable).
